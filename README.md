# Number-Guessing-Game-In-C
- A game where the program randomly selects a number and the player has to guess 
it within a range, with feedback such as a "too high" or "too low".

- This program will teach ,e the use of functions like rand(), 
Conditional Statements to provide feedback (Either "too High" or "Too Low"), 
Loops to repeatedly ask for questions, User Input Handling to accept guesses.

# Project Structure.
1. Main File(main.c):
- This will contain the core game logic, including the main loop that handles user input and gives feedback.
2. Header File(game.h):
- Contains function declarations and any constant values (like the number range).
3. Game Logic File(game.c):
- Contains the implementation of functions, like generating a random number, 
  handling the guessing process, and providing feedback.
